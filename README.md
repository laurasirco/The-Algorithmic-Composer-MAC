The-Algorithmic-Composer
========================

## Synopsis


The Algorithmic Composer is an algorithmic composition application made by me as my final degree project. It has implementation of many music compositions methods:

-   **Independent Stochastic** (based on density probability functions affecting pitches, durations and the ratio between notes and silences).
-     1st order **Markov Chains** from a MIDI file.
-     **Random Walk**
-     **Fractional noise**
-     **Chaotic Response**
-     **Motivic Development** of a musical motive from many sources.
-     **Serialism**

It works under **openFrameworks** as well as **ofxUI** and **ofxXmlSettings** addons and **midiFile** and **midiFileReader** libraries. Currently it only works on Mac OS X and iOS (you'll need to make a new project with all the classes to compile in iOS). It won't be hard to get Linux and Windows version.

The application come with a user interface for testing the methods and get your own algorithmically generated music. You can also export the composition to a MIDI file.

## Motivation

The application borns as an idea from my final degree tutor *Jose Manuel Iñesta Quereda* to develop a program capable of showing the strengh and possibilities of algorithmic composition for people who needs it's own music for their projects. He ask me to make an application that contains basic implementations of the principals algorithmic composition methods. 

I started development at firsts of June os 2014 and I'm finishing a very very early version on finals of August. It has a lot of options and possibilities as well as lacks of methods and new ideas that wasn't developed because of the deadline (5th of September).

## Installation

Simply open the Xcode project and compile it. Feel free of see and change the code on your own purposes. Email me any question or issue (laurasirco@gmail.com).

## Tests

Youtube videos.
